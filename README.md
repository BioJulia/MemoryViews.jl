This package implements `MemoryView`, a simple, low-level view into a chunk of `Memory`, as well as the `MemoryKind` trait to guide dispatch of generic methods to memory views.
It is intended to be used as a foundational base for other packages.

To learn how to use the package, [read the documentation](https://biojulia.github.io/MemoryViews.jl/dev/)

## Example
### Basic usage
```julia
# Create complex nested types backed by memory
v1 = view(codeunits("abc"), :)
v2 = view([0x61, 0x62, 0x63], Base.OneTo(3))

# This call hits the slow, generic fallback implementation in Base,
# because it's very difficult to correctly cover all possible
# combinations of types in the method
copyto!(v2, v1)

# These are ordinary `AbstractVector`s, in this case with
# element type UInt8.
mem1 = MemoryView(v1)
mem2 = MemoryView(v2)

# Both views are `MemoryView{UInt8}`, which has the fast path
# implemented. Precisely because we represent "memory" as a simple,
# concrete types, it's easier to provide these kinds of guarantees.
copyto!(mem2, mem1)

# Use the memory views as ordinary vectors
fst = mem1[1]
reverse!(mem2) # ... etc
```

### Dispatching to MemoryView
```julia
function foo(x::ImmutableMemoryView)
    # low-level implementation
end

function foo(::NotMemory, x::AbstractArray)
    # slow, generic fallback
end

# Dispatch with the `MemoryKind` trait
foo(::IsMemory, x) = foo(ImmutableMemoryView(x))
foo(x) = foo(MemoryKind(typeof(x)), x)

# Optionally: Also support strings
foo(x::AbstractString) = foo(codeunits(x))
```

## API differences from `Memory`
* For `v::MemoryView`, `v[1:3]` creates a view into the same memory, instead of allocating new backing memory.
* `copyto!` and `unsafe_copyto!` do not take starting indices. Instead, simply create new views starting at the desired indices.

## Limitations
* Many optimised fast methods for more established types like `Vector` are missing for `MemoryView`.
  These are added over time. Please make an issue or a PR as you encounter missing methods.

* Currently, `MemoryView` does not make use of `Core.GenericMemory`'s additional parameters, such as atomicity or address space.
  This may easily be added with a `GenericMemoryView` type, similar to `Memory` / `GenericMemory`.

* Currently, `String`s are not backed by `Memory` in Julia. Therefore, creating a `MemoryView` of a string
  requires heap-allocating a new `Memory` pointing to the existing memory of the string.
  This can be fixed if `String` is re-implemented to be backed by `Memory`, but I don't know
  enough details about the implementation of `String` to know if this is practical.
